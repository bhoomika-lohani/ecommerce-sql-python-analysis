# E-commerce Data Analysis using SQL and Python

## Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset using SQL for querying and Python for data analysis and visualization.
The goal is to extract meaningful business insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and retention.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (SQLite)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle

## Key Analysis
- Total sales by product category
- Monthly order trends
- Average Order Value (AOV) analysis
- Customer retention and repeat purchase behavior

## Business Insights
- A small set of product categories drives the majority of revenue.
- Order volume shows consistent growth over time.
- AOV remains stable, indicating predictable spending behavior.
- Only a small percentage of customers make repeat purchases, indicating low retention.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates practical SQL querying, Python-based analysis, and business-focused storytelling—skills relevant to real world data analysis and business decision making.
